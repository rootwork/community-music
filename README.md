Drupal community music group distribution
===============

This is a placeholder file for upcoming work.

The Drupal community music group distribution will be a fork of the [Pushtape](https://github.com/Pushtape) [Drupal distribution](https://drupal.org/project/pushtape). Consequently, it makes no sense to commit anything until I'm actually ready to start development, since Pushtape might change in the meantime.

## Differences with Pushtape

Pushtape puts the focus on music (albums, tracks, etc.) which makes a lot of sense for bands that exist on sales of this media. For community music groups, however, they might be much more interested in putting the focus on events (concerts) rather than albums.

Consequently, this distro will feature an **events system** with integrated **maps and directions** powered by [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), [IP Geolocation Views & Maps](https://drupal.org/project/ip_geoloc) and [Get Directions](https://drupal.org/project/getdirections). It will automatically provide an **upcoming events feature** on the home page, rather than putting all the focus on news items.

This distro provides a framework for **managing booking and audition requests** with [webform](https://drupal.org/project/webform) and [honeypot](https://drupal.org/project/honeypot).

It builds on the excellent responsive foundation of Pushtape's Flux theme with a few other **responsive improvements** like [responsive menus](https://drupal.org/project/responsive_menus), [accessibility titles](https://drupal.org/project/a11y_titles), [fastclick](http://ftlabs.github.io/fastclick/) and [fitvids](http://fitvidsjs.com/).

Finally, this distro adds built-in **social media settings**, both in the form of widgets provided by [socialite](http://socialitejs.com/) and metadata powered by [metatag](https://drupal.org/project/metatag), [xmlsitemap](https://drupal.org/project/xmlsitemap) and [site verify](https://drupal.org/project/site_verify).

## Background

This fork of Pushtape was created for the [Bells of the Cascades](http://bellsofthecascades.org/) website. If there were enough reasons to create a handbell-specific distribution, you know it would be called DruBell ;)
